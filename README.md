# AI-Chatbot

How to get the project started :
Clone the project from github
Do “npm install express @google-cloud/dialogflow uuid” on the terminal
Run node app on the terminal 
Check if recommendations.json is their in the folder(It’s there in the repo) Otherwise I’ll send it through drive or something
Change the localhost url in index.js(fetchmsg() function)  and app.js (post request in the beginning. Indicated by comment)
Run the index.html (This the chatbot interface)
//Sometimes there is an issue with the dialogflow api and it returns “Network error” so just reload the screen when that happens.
