# AI-Chatbot

How to get the project started :
Clone the project from github<br/>
Do “npm install express @google-cloud/dialogflow uuid” on the terminal<br/>
Run node app on the terminal<br/>
Check if recommendations.json is their in the folder(It’s there in the repo) Otherwise I’ll send it through drive or something<br/>
Change the localhost url in index.js(fetchmsg() function)  and app.js (post request in the beginning. Indicated by comment)<br/>
Run the index.html (This the chatbot interface)<br/>
//Sometimes there is an issue with the dialogflow api and it returns “Network error” so just reload the screen when that happens.<br/>
